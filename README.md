# PhysicsClass

I pretended to be a physics teacher that need to prepare for the upcoming semester. I wanted to provide my students with some functions that will help them calculate some fundamental physical properties. I did this by writing Python functions that involved physics equations, including but not limited to: acceleration, mass, distance, energy, force and work.
